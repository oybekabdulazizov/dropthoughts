# DropThoughts

Gotta give the credit. What can I say? 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Demo 

Thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can see the deployed app [here](https://dropthoughts.vercel.app/).
But first, I suggest reading the below description quickly. 


## Description

The ultimate social networking app designed to share your thoughts with your closest friends and loved ones like never before. 
We intergrated the authentication process with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) so you'll have a seamless experience when signing up, signing in, and resetting your password. So, go on, get started with DropThoughts. 
Find the people you know and follow them. Add an image and your thought into a single post and share with your followers. Wanna leave a comment on someone's thought? Do it. You can. 
Did a thought or a comment touch your hear? Hit the like and find all your fav thoughts in your profile. 
Search for the profiles and thoughts, check your activity page to see who loved or left a reply to your thought.  

When you really like someone else's thought you can just "re-post" it. Easy. 
Wanna share a post somewhere outside DropThoughts? Hit share and choose the option available. There is plenty. 

You can, of course, manage (edit or delete) your thoughts and comments, archive or unarchive them, and unfollow other users if you are bored. Just a quick note though, if you delete a thought or comment, any reply to that post gets removed too. So, you might wanna just archive it and be the only one who can see it.
