# Threads

Gotta give the credit. What can I say? 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

This is a clone of that famous Threads of Instagram. Well, it does not have the exact features of original Threads, 
but I did implement nice features in it. 

Please sign up with your email or google account, go through the app, and let me know if there are any critical bugs. 

Now, this cloned app can be further improved with: 
- thread images 
- re-threading 
- sharing threads 
- following other users 
- blocking other users 
- un/archiving threads 
- tagging other users in threads 
- infinite scroll or pagination on home page 
- and so on...

However, looking at the already existing features and their code, I am quite sure I can implement the additional features, but I decided to move on to enrich my portfolio with different apps.
